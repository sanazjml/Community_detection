    options.edge_weight: a double array over the vertices with an edge
        weight for each node
 
  Note: 'auto' cannot be used with 'nocheck' = 1.  The 'auto' algorithm

  Note: 'auto' cannot be used with 'nocheck' = 1.  The 'auto' algorithms
  checks the number of edges in A and if the graph is more than 10% dense,
  it uses the Floyd-Warshall algorithm instead of Johnson's algorithm.

    options.ec_list: do not form the sparse matrix with edge [{0} | 1]
 
  Note: the edge centrality can also be returned as an edge list using the
  options.ec_list options.  This option can eliminate some ambiguity in the
  output matrix E when the edge centrality of an edge is 0 and Matlab drops
  the edge from the sparse matrix.

  network A with source u and sink v as well as additional information.  
  For each vertex on the source side of the mincut, mincut(i) = 1, 
  for each vertex on the sink side, mincut(i) = -1.  
  R is the residual graph.  R(i,j) is the amount of unused capacity 
  on edge (i,j).  F is the flow graph, F(i,j) is the amount of used 
  capacity on edge (i,j).  F, A, and R satisfy the relationship A = F + R.
 
  The algorithm used is the push-relabel algorithm.
 
  ... = max_flow(A,optionsu) sets optional parameters (see 
  set_matlab_bgl_options) for the standard options.
    There are no additional options for this function.
 
  Note: the values on A are interpreted as integers, please round them
  yourself to get the best interpretation.  The code uses the floor of 
  the values in A.
 
  Example:

\subsubsection*{erdos\_reyni}
\begin{mcode}
  ERDOS_REYNI Generates a random Erdos-Reyni (Gnp) graph
 
  A=erdos_reyni(n,p) generates a random Gnp graph with n vertices and where
  the probability of each edge is p.  The resulting graph is symmetric.
 
  This function is different from the Boost Graph library version, it was
  reimplemented natively in Matlab.
 
  Example:
    A = erdos_reyni(100,0.05);

\subsubsection*{cycle\_graph}
\begin{mcode}
  CYCLE_GRAPH Generate the cycle graph of order n
 
  The cycle graph is a simple cycle with n vertices.
 
  [A xy] = cycle_graph(n) generates a cycle graph with n vertices and
  returns the adjacency matrix in A.  The matrix xy stores two-dimensional 
  coordinates for each vertex.
 
  Example:
    [A xy] = cycle_graph(10);
    gplot(A,xy);

\subsubsection*{star\_graph}
\begin{mcode}
  STAR_GRAPH Generate the star graph of order n
 
  The star graph is a simple star with n vertices.  Vertex n is the center
  vertex.
 
  [A xy] = star_graph(n) generates a star graph with n vertices and
  returns the adjacency matrix in A.  The matrix xy stores two-dimensional 
  coordinates for each vertex.
 
  Example:
    [A xy] = star_graph(10);
    gplot(A,xy);

\subsubsection*{wheel\_graph}
\begin{mcode}
  WHEEL_GRAPH Construct a wheel graph of order n
 
  The wheel graph is a cycle graph of order n-1 along with an additional
  vertex that connects all the remaining vertices.  (Run the example and it
  will be extremely clear if you are still confused.)
 
  [A xy] = wheel_graph(n) returns the adjacency matrix for the wheel graph
  of order n.  The matrix xy stores two-dimensional coordinates for each 
  vertex.
 
  Example:
    [A xy] = wheel_graph(10);
    gplot(A,xy);

\subsubsection*{combine\_visitors}
\begin{mcode}
  COMBINE_VISITORS Generate a new visitor by combining existing visitors
 
  cv = combine_visitors(v1, v2, ...) generates a new algorithm visitor that
  works by calling the functions in v1 followed by the functions in v2, and
  so on.  
 
  The value returned by the combined visitor function is the bitwise & of
  all the individual return values.  So, if any visitor requests the
  algorithm to halt, then the algorithm will halt.
 
  Note: using a combined visitor is somewhat slower than writing a custom
  combined visitor yourself.
 
  Example:
     vis1 = struct();
     vis1.examine_vertex = @(u) fprintf('vis1: examine_vertex(%i)\n', u);
     vis2 = struct();
     vis2.examine_vertex = @(u) fprintf('vis2: examine_vertex(%i)\n', u);
     combined_vis = combine_visitors(vis1, vis2);
     load graphs/bfs_example.mat

\subsubsection*{set\_matlab\_bgl\_default}
\begin{mcode}
  SET_MATLAB_BGL_DEFAULT Sets a default option for the Matlab BGL interface
 
  old_default = set_matlab_bgl_default(options)
  options.istrans: the input matrices are already transposed [{0} | 1]
  options.nocheck: skip the input checking [{0} | 1]
  options.full2sparse: convert full matrices to sparse [{0} | 1]
 
  to get the current set of default options, call
  options = set_matlab_bgl_default()
 
  These options can make the Matlab BGL interface more efficient by
  eliminating the copying operations that occur between Matlab's structures
  and the BGL structures.  However, they are more difficult to use and are
  disabled by default.
 
  Generally, they are best used when you want to perform a large series of
  computations.
 
  e.g.
  % tranpose the matrix initially...
  At = A'
  old_options = set_matlab_bgl_default(struct('istrans',1));
  % perform a bunch of graph work with At...
  d1 = dfs(At,1); d2 = dfs(At,2); ...
  % restore the old options 
  set_matlab_bgl_default(old_options);
\end{mcode}
